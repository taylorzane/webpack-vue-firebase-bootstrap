# Skeleton Project using Webpack, VueJS, Firebase, and Bootstrap 4

This is a project that makes creating a VueJS + Firebase application quick and simple.

Fork it, mod it, do whatever with it.

`src/app.coffee` has a simple Vue model connected to Firebase. It is only one way (Firebase -> Vue), but it's a simple proof of concept.
